# UMTS-KPI-Charts-based-on-measured-Key-Performance-Indicators
UMTS 3G Technology charts based on measured Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the following KPIs being CS &amp; PS RRC &amp; RAB, Cell Availability, CS &amp; PS Traffic, Cell DCH UEs, Mean TCP and RTWP.

UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) is a 3G mobile network technology. It's essentially the 3G evolution of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and is also known as "3GSM." UMTS uses W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access), a type of CDMA technology, to provide higher data speeds and improved capacity compared to its predecessor, GSM.

3G KPI PERFORMANCE CHARTS

The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) capture the performance of certain cells.

1. For accessibility KPIs, represented here are CS & PS RRC and RAB SSR which is the ability of a user to access the UMTS network successfully; to utilize the available services.


2. CS measured in Erl & PS Traffic measured in MB  with cell availability in percentage(%). Traffic refers to the data, voice, and signaling that is transmitted through the network. It encompasses both the user data (like web browsing, video streaming, or audio calls) and the network control signals needed to manage and establish connections. Essentially, it's the amount of information flowing through the UMTS network at any given time. 


3. (RWTP)Received Total Wideband Power, is a measurement that indicates the total level of noise or interference within the UMTS frequency band of a cell. It's a crucial parameter for network optimization and troubleshooting, particularly for uplink interference.


4. We have Number of DCH Users represented together with TCP which stands for Transmission Control Protocol, which is a crucial protocol for data transfer and reliability over networks. While UMTS itself is a cellular network technology, TCP is a fundamental part of the internet protocol suite used to facilitate communication between devices, including those connected through UMTS networks.
